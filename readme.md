# Signup and Login System with OTP Verification

## Project Overview

This project is a web application featuring a complete signup and login flow with email OTP verification. It includes error handling, a mobile-friendly design, and follows best practices for security and authentication. The application also provides options for users to reset their passwords.

## Features

1. **Signup Flow with Email OTP Verification**
   - Users can sign up by providing their email address and other necessary details.
   - An OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to the userâ€™s email for verification.
   - The signup is completed only after successful OTP verification.
   - Users are shown a welcome page with their information post verification.

2. **Error Handling**
   - Clear error messages are displayed in case of:
     - Incorrect OTP
     - Incorrect form details
     - API failures (e.g., no internet connection)

3. **Login Flow**
   - Users can log in using their email and password.
   - Post-login, users are redirected to the same welcome page displaying their information.

4. **Mobile-Friendly Design**
   - The UI is designed based on the provided Figma design and is optimized for mobile devices using responsive design techniques.

5. **Password Management**
   - Passwords are hashed using industry-standard hashing algorithms.
   - JWT (JSON Web Token) is used for secure authentication and session management.
   - Logged-in users have the option to reset their password by providing their current password and a new password.
